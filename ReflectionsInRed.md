While writing this walkthrough I assume that the reader is rather intelligent
person who also likes this game and is able to read readables, loot lootables
and explore explorable by himself without my stimulating.

## === INFO FROM THE AUTHOR OF THIS WALKTHROUGH ===

Visually stunning mission with many non-standard mechanics. Nothing you haven't seen before plot-wise, but the execution is of the high quality. Take some time to admire a main villain when you have a chance.

## === Reflections In Red ===

Burlow's Wine Recepie and the East Wing Key are in the Burlow's quarters on the third floor. Just go upstairs, nothing is hidden, no secrets or anything alike.

[Secret area] A closet with a timberbox? Pay attention to the ceiling -- there is a passage. Read the diary on the table: another villain-vampire is luring Garrett in his manor.

[Secret] A lever that opens the painting is under the bedside table on the left side of the master's bed.

A door to the East Wing is near the room where you found the tinberbox.

Agnes' room (East Wing). Passage in the ceiling. Traverse through the vent, climb a little higher and you'll have a chance to vitness a meeting of Lord Burlow and Wexler about the gem.

"Trail" objective is closed by reading the diary on Burlow's table after his transformation.

Laboratory key is on the "Trail" diary. Laboratory is in the attic. But pay attention that there are a few attics here. 

Laboratory has the dagger and the "Wine cellar key" upstairs and the "Strange key" on the lower floor of the laboratory.

The Wine Cellar is underground, near the food storage and the kitchen. The Wine Cellar has a shaft in the floor leading to the water, crypt and, eventually, outside.

Don't forget to get the Old Wine from the Cellar.

Wexler's people keep the explosives outside. In front of the main entrance.

Go to the Wine Cellar. Make sure that the vampire is there (theoretically you can use the dagger to lure him in with some blood, but in my case it was stalking me almost constantly). Put a barrel with explosives on a marked spot, use a tinderbox on the explosives and jump in the shaft to the water again.

Remember a cell with a woman? The "Strange Key" opens it. Take the lady with you to the exit point.
