T2 FM: The library of Babel (Text walkthrough)

    While writing this walkthrough I assume that the reader is rather intelligent
    person who also likes this game and is able to read readables, loot lootables
    and explore explorable by himself without my stimulating.

    1) Take the "KEY FROM THE WALL" which is hidden under the shelf
    in the very room you have appeared.

    2) Use "KEY FROM THE WALL" to open the only closed door you have
    access to.

    3) Note "GLUE" and "MIRROR" in the rooms behind that door.

    4) Find a doorframe blocked with thick wood and with a broken
    hole in it. Look at the ceiling and note a "CHEESE" in the spiderweb.

    5) Move further and note a "MOUSE" in a doorframe blocked
    with thin wooden planks.

    6) In the broom closet pick up a "SPONGE" in the square water basket.

    7) Note an orange "LASER" beam.

    8) In a room with two shelves and a writing table pick up the "OIL LAMP"
    from the table.

    9) Use "OIL LAMP" on the rusted crunk near the fountain (almost at the beginning)
    and pick up the "STONE"

    10) USE the "STONE" on the "CHEESE" and give the "CHEESE" to the "MOUSE".
    Get the "Rat's key"

    11) Use "SPONGE" on the "MIRROR". Take "MIRROR".

    12) Use "MIRROR" on the "LASER" (this will destroy the emitter).

    13) Use the "RAT'S KEY" and pick up the "WALKING CANE" just behind
    the door which you just have opened with "RAT'S KEY"

    14) Use "WALKING CANE" on "GLUE" and use "STICKY CANE" to pick up
    the "KEY FROM THE DRAIN" (Under the big wooden stairs)

    15) "KEY FROM THE DRAIN" will open the last closed door (on the right hand
    from the laser)

    16) Go to the "ORANGE CLOUD"

    17) The END.

    This mission took ~20 minutes (knowing exactly what to do while making
    this walkthrough notes in the foreign language)
