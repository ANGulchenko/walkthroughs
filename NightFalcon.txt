    T2 FM: The Night Falcon (Text walkthrough)

        While writing this walkthrough I assume that the reader is rather intelligent
        person who also likes this game and is able to read readables, loot lootables
        and explore explorable by himself without my stimulating.

        I) There aren't hideously hidden things in this mapset.
        No pixel-hunting or need for blind frobbing. But you should look in the "standard"
        places for a coin or two.
        II) There are many guards here. But they aren't dangerous. Their routes are simple
        and they aren't vigilant.
        III) No tool transition between the levels.
        IV) Buy anti-undead weaponry whenever you have a chance. Undead are deadly. And plenty.

        ============= A SHOPPING WALK =================

        There is a switch on the right side of the hearth in the kitchen which opens the
        secret passage in that hearth. Go up by the ladder and get to the attic. Pay attention
        to the tapestry under the lamp and the thick rug on the floor. Both open
        by a switch at the top of the stovepipe and hold Garrett's tools.

        The rope arrows can be found in a secret (unlit torch) in a small garden
        accessible through a door in a toilet of Garrett's house.

        Marek (and -- most importantly -- his key) is in the pub right opposite Garrett's
        house.

        The passage to the Marek's house (there is, actually, a whole district) is a ladder
        in the shadowy corner on the left side of the pub.

        A secret stash of money is in the pub's hearth. In the kitchen.

        The secret safe in the theatre can be opened by a clothes-hook-switch near the
        piano, behind the curtain.

        Check the left water valve in Marek's bathroom to get his watch.

        There is a secret (needed for the objective) in the High Priest Maurus' room --
        clothes-hook near the bed.

        Secret in the crypt -- the switch behind the big statue.

        You can turn off the light near the lord Wellhofer's manor entrance: the switch
        is located in the park zone.

        There is an underwater passage near the boat. It leads to the bank.

        The key to the police chief's office is in the secret in the police checkpoint
        (on the side of the bookshelf). And his office has a secret too (opens with
        a book on the shelf)

        You can get to the weapons shop by getting over the fence (using rope arrow) in
        alley on the left hand from the shop entrance.

        ============= LORD WELLHOFER =================

        The unlit torch in the mine office building will open the secret with a key
        to the mine elevator.

        The dagger needed for the objectives list is in the mine, in the zone with 2
        spiders and a wooden bridge over the water. Dive into the "lake" and swim to
        the underwater tunnel.

        To get to the mansion you should find a brick wall in the mines. There is a
        button to open that wall. It is situated on the wooden beams right near the wall.

        Lord Wellhofer (and his key) is in the dining room. This room has a light
        switch on your left.

        There is an important scroll in the study room, on the scene's floor.

        The library key is behind the bed in the room at the very end of the corridor on
        the second floor. There is a stationary guard near it.

        The "serpentile torc" is in the library; behind the flag, above the roof beams.

        There is a secret room under the library stairs. It can be opened with a book
        on the shelf (accessible with a ladder). You should also climb the shelves in
        that room to find another important scroll.

        There is a secret in the prison. Pull a wall handcuffs in a room with iron lady
        and a rack.

        ============= THE HAMMERITE MONASTERY =================

        To get through two guards guarding the big gate you should go to the clearing
        with a pond and find a passage there in the bushes.

        There is secret with the "Builder's Holy Hammer" behind the green stained glass
        with an image of a hammer.

        There is a flask of holy water in a room with a pool near the toilets.

        To get into the crypt you should throw the Holy Hammer to the stained glass window
        in a room on the right hand from the main altar. There you should find two unlit
        torches -- frobbing them will open a passage to the king Gerhard's stone.
        Edmund's scepter is also in this crypt. To exit the crypt (after getting the
        red stone) use the unlit torch near the stained glass window similar to the one
        you used to get in.

        The door to the basement can be opened by the sword. There you should find 2
        unlit torches to open the further way. In the laboratory, there is a secret with
        objectives list's book. It is openable by frobbing a microscope on the upper shelf.

        ============= THE CATHEDRAL =================

        The "artifact" is hidden in the small office on the second floor. Use the
        unlit torch to open the secret.

        The book with a legend of the Brotherhood is hidden behind the bed in the
        High Priest's quarters (on the second floor).

        The hidden treasure is in the basement in the room with big crates and a stained
        glass window.

        The sword is in the crypt. In a secret openable by a hammer attached to stained
        glass window.

        ============= THE MYSTERIOUS TOWER =================

        The pharmacist's secret stash is in the attic. The secret opens by the banjo.

        There is a secret switch on the most left pew (looking from the church entrance
        position)

        The key to the "Hammerite crypt" is in the High priest's office. In the secret
        behind the flag. It can be opened with a hammer on the window.

        There is an unlit torch in the cemetery which opens a passage to the tower zone.
        But nothing interesting there except for the loot: no way inside the tower there.

        There is a secret in the bookseller's house: clothes-hook in the dead-end room with
        2 paintings (portrait and a building).

        The secret passage in the crypt is openable by frobbing one of the sculls near
        the hammer monument. This passage leads to the "Hammerite Stone."

        Access to the sewer is in the pharmacist's cellar. And in the sewers
        you will find an unlit torch which will open the passage to the lord Hafner's house.
        Hafner's bracelet is hidden in the secret behind the painting right in front
        of the front door. The secret is activated by a switch on the roof beams.

        ============= CHRISTMAS PRESENTS =================

        Expedition equipment is in the weapons dealer's office. The key to the office is on
        the dealer himself and he is sleeping on the second floor of the weapons shop.

        The Hrothgar's "Enchanted forest" can be stolen by the secret in the museum
        curator's office: a clothes-hook on the bookshelf.

        The golden falcon is in the inn. Not hidden. Just go and take it. The only
        reason why I mention it because it is in the objectives list.

        Castle maps are in the manager's office, on the bookshelf.

        ============= THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE FALCON =================

        There is an icy tunnel on the left hand from the place where you come into
        the zone with semi-transparent icy-tree-beasts and a broken castle gate. This
        tunnel will lead you to another -- even more broken, but passable -- gate.

        Blue evaporating pool in an ominous room? Jump into it -- it is a path to a treasury.

        To open the path to "evil" they all are talking about, you should find 3 unlit torches
        (1 -- opposite the unfrobable door on the second door, 2 -- damaged small room
        in the same corridor, behind the doot leaned to the wall, 3 -- office on the first
        floor)

        There is a small secret in the weaponry: a button behind the barrels.

        There is a secret under the stairs: you'll find a corpse of Ar-Zimrathon and his key.
        Using his key will bring you outside. There you should use your red stones near
        the statues. That'll open the big door where the Falcon Statue is stored.
