While writing this walkthrough I assume that the reader is rather intelligent
person who also likes this game and is able to read readables, loot lootables
and explore explorable by himself without my stimulating.

=== INFO FROM THE AUTHOR OF THIS WALKTHROUGH ===

Very small horror-themed mission. Keyhunts are plenty but they are fair: no 
pixel-hunting or doing something extremely non-standard. Everything is in plain 
view but just in places where you wouldn't want to search thoroughly. But because 
of the small area of the mission, keyhunt doesn't transform into frustration.

=== ANYBODY... HOME? ===

Try to turn on the electric light to get a new objective.

Read the diary on the bookshelf.

Take a skillet in the kitchen.

Take a holy powder in the kitchen (under the cooking table)

The balcony key is on the kitchen floor (it is hard to see this key in the dark)

The apartment keys are in the room with the TV.

Read the book on the balcony.

An "empty flask" is behind the sacks on the balcony.

Millie's room key is on the wooden crate on the balcony.

Read a letter under the sofa in the kid's room.

Give a few kicks with a skillet to the skeleton in the dresser in your room 
until it dismantles and you'll receive a "light box" key. 
The light box is outside the flat.

Push a lift button to get a crowbar.

Use the crowbar to open the room near the bathroom. The safe code is 3626. 2 is 
because the neighbor lives on the floor below.

To make holy water, go to the kitchen, turn on the water, put an "empty flask" 
in the sink and use holy powder on the flask.

Use the holy water on the crystal.

Go to the staircase.
