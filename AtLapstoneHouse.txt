While writing this walkthrough I assume that the reader is rather intelligent
person who also likes this game and is able to read readables, loot lootables
and explore explorable by himself without my stimulating.

=== INFO FROM THE AUTHOR OF THIS WALKTHROUGH ===

Small manor/yard mission. Nothing too complicated, nothing too unexpected. High quality though.
The mission has 3 guards with thick helmets but I have found only 2 gas arrows.

This walkthrough is for the Expert difficulty mode.

=== At Lapstone House ===

[Evidence] "A scroll about the idol" is on the belt of a pirate-looking guard near the port exit.

The warehouse near the port exit can be entered though the window. "Warehouse key" is inside on a patrolling guard. See that sleeping guard? You can walk around that noisy gate through the ventilation system. Look at the ceiling in a nearby room.

[Evidence] "Pagan Idol" is in the crate, near the sleeping guard in the warehouse.

The "decrepit key" can be found on a skeleton in the ventilations shafts above the first floor (easy to access through the kitchen). This key opens a grave in the statue park. A Sea Captain's Map is there (secret objective). Light up 2 torches to open a room with a spyglass (bonus objective). You can find fire arrows at the "gazebo" outside and in the kitchen.

[Secret] Switch in the Steward room. Under the windows, on some kind of sofa.

You can get to the Master bedroom through the ventilation shafts. Most convienient entrance is in the toilets on the 2nd floor.

"Master Willy's key" is in the Master bedroom.

Dice (objective) are in the game room and their compartment is closed with "Master Willy's key".

[Secret] Switch near the statue in the office on the 2nd floor. "Small safe key" there and a [Evidence]letter.

"Small safe key" opens a safe in the Master bedroom.

A blue vase you are looking for is in the Master bedroom.

[Secret] A small switch in a safe in the Master bedroom opens another safe with the "Heart of the Sea"
