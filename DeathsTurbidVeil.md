While writing this walkthrough I assume that the reader is rather intelligent
person who also likes this game and is able to read readables, loot lootables
and explore explorable by himself without my stimulating.

## === INFO FROM THE AUTHOR OF THIS WALKTHROUGH ===

This mission is much bigger than you might expect after a few minutes of familiariasing with a map layout.   
It starts with a classical mansion robbing mood and slowly transitions to something comletely different.   
This FM has many things that can easily push away players: pitch dark places, unkillable enemies and unkillable enemies in pitch dark places. 
Even infamous piano-based puzzles. But somehow author managed to keep difficulty/annoyance of these nuances in 
line, so they are not as bad as you can expect.    

Visually all is top notch. Many nonstandard objects. Might lag a little at some points outside.

This walkthrough is done for the top difficulty.

## === Death's Turbid Veil ===

Plant Fertilizer is in the Greenhouse. You can use it on a crack in the sidewalk near the mansion (not far from the shed with a passage to the cellar. Corner of the main building)

Dead Rat can be found in the Stable (on a platform without a ladder)

Jardelian Plumeria flower grows in the small greenwalled garden near the gazebo with a guard.    

"Patio key" is in the Study on the Ground floor.

Butler's room has the "Strange Note" in a garbage bin.

"Cauldron" is in the kitchen.

Read notes in the Drawing Room (second one is in the fireplace) and take the "Clockwork winding key". Use this key on the clock in the Parlour and set the time to 12:00. Take the "Jeweled crown of the Queen Azcha".
