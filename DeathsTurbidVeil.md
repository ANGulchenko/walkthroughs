While writing this walkthrough I assume that the reader is rather intelligent
person who also likes this game and is able to read readables, loot lootables
and explore explorable by himself without my stimulating.

## === INFO FROM THE AUTHOR OF THIS WALKTHROUGH ===

This mission is much bigger than you might expect after a few minutes of familiariasing with a map layout.   
It starts with a classical mansion robbing mood and slowly transitions to something comletely different.   
This FM has many things that can easily push away players: pitch dark places, unkillable enemies and unkillable enemies in pitch dark places.    
Even infamous piano-based puzzles. But somehow author managed to keep difficulty/annoyance of these nuances in line, so they are not as bad as you can expect.    

Visually all is top notch. Many nonstandard objects. Might lag a little at some points outside.

This walkthrough is done for the top difficulty.

## === Death's Turbid Veil ===

Plant Fertilizer is in the Greenhouse. You can use it on a crack in the sidewalk near the mansion (not far from the shed with a passage to the cellar. Corner of the main building)

Dead Rat can be found in the Stable (on a platform without a ladder)

Jardelian Plumeria flower grows in the small greenwalled garden near the gazebo with a guard.

Lycarian wine is in the tower above the boarded room. On the windowsill.

"Patio key" is in the Study on the Ground floor.

Butler's room has the "Strange Note" in a garbage bin.

"Cauldron" is in the kitchen.

Read notes in the Drawing Room (second one is in the fireplace) and take the "Clockwork winding key". Use this key on the clock in the Parlour and set the time to 12:00. Take the "Jeweled crown of the Queen Azcha".

"Paint smeared paper" is in the tower above the boarded room.

"Old note" is important. You can find it in the tower above the detective's room.

[Secret] Coins on the beams above the passage between balcony and Library.

How to get into the Boarded Room? Turn the switch above the armchair under the stairs to the tower. The armchair will slide away.

The "Library key" is in the Boarded Room.

The Library has a book about magic dispelling.

The "Master bedroom key" is in the Library.

The Master bedroom has a ladder to the loft (look for an openable tile on the ceiling). Use your lantern to find a ladder in the pitch-black area in the chimney. This ladder leads to the Vault. Use the combination from the "Paint-smeared paper" to open the Vault: Orange-Green-Blue-Violet-White.

Flint-and-Steel is in the vault (you can also use it outside the objective-releated purpose for lighting lanterns in the mines)

Vault has an exit button on the top shelf near the big wooden crate. It will open a passage to mines. Pitch black mines with unkillable zombies. Nothing you can do to them at the first visit to the mines, so just avoid them. Mines layout isn't very mazeish, so navigation through them won't be a big problem.

While in the mines, look for a few chunks of ore. It isn't important to do at the first time you get to the mines. Later it would be more convenient, but you need those chunks for a mission objective.

Mines also have a "Foreman's logbook" and a mines map nearby. This logbook is also important for an objective.

Descend to the lowest part of the mines and read a notebook of a vampire. Get additional Marianne-related objectives. Don't try to fetch her now: it would be very inconvenient, so ignore her and jump into the hole near her. Now move-move-move forward until you find yourself in the crypt of the "Order of the Dragon".

Don't miss the "Crypt key" on the Armand's tomb. Yes, it is there, look more thoroughly.

Door saying about using holy water on tombs to get 20 points? Shoot Kirul, Eidor and Gadros tombs to achieve that. The door will open, letting you to meet Clastor.

Clastor will give you a new objective: to pass trials to get the sword (this sword can kill those unkillable zomvies and the vampire, so you want it). He also privide you with "Knight Seal".

Clastor's Ankh od Protection is on Clastor's body.

[Secret] A goblet above the Clastor's tomb. Use a rope arrow.

Jump into the well outside the manor and swim around until you get a chance to get out of water. You'll see a place to use the "Knight's Seal". Now you have a passage to the Clastor's trials.

Knight trial. "The worthy pilgrim lets not the gaze of death fall upon him". Rather selfexplanatory: avoid moving in front of the skulls on the pillars. Take a "Part of the Seal" on the far end of that room. No shortway for exit, so repeat your steps backward.

Knight trial. "The worthy pilgrim displays caution and agility". Just jump over the platforms in the dark. Take another "Part of Seal". No shortway back here either.

Knight trial. "The worthy pilgrim has a cunning mind". The answer is "Your word". A seal is appered high under the ceiling (bug?). Still jumpable high.

Now you can open the gates nearby using the 3 parts of the Seal and get "Clastor's sword". It is very effective against those unkillable zombies. Return to the surface to the well you used to come here.

The Loft above the library (openable tile in the ceiling again) has a magic circle. Put a cauldron there. Then wine, plumeria, rat. Use flint-and-steel in the end. Take "Death mask" from the beam above the door to the next room.

Now you can return to the mines and kill the vampire. 4-5 sword hits would be enough. Take Marianne with you to the surface (or kill her).

Picture gallery puzzle. Reread "Strange note": knight, bird, knife, shield, ship, tower. Look for these objects on the paintings and activate them. Get an objective necklace and some loot from the wall safe.

[Secret x2]Piano. At least we are not forced to solve this puzzle by hearing. In notes we got 2 codes: DECADE and F#A#D#E. Now we should play this on the piano keyboard. Keys are in this order(from left to right): CDEFGAB... Then repeats. CDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGAB... "#" means that we should press not the white key, but adjacent (from the right side) black key. But that's not all regarding this puzzle: DECADE should be entered using the keys from the left side of the keyboard and F#A#D#E -- with the keys from the right part of the keyboard. Middle octaves are useless even if the notes are correct. Both codes will provide you with loot and considered secrets.

The exit is in the well. Swim around in the dark until you find the "sewer access" gate. Push a lever when you're ready.
